1) Create an input field(in App component) with a change listner which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g in a paragraph).
2) Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which recieves the text length as a prop
3) inside the ValidationComponent either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the length (e.g. take 10 as a min length)
4) Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box(=> display:inline-block;padding:16px, text-allign:center,margin:16px,border:1px solid)
5) Render a list of CharComponent where each CharComponent recieves a diffferent letter of the entered text(in the intial input field) as prop.
6) when you click a CharComponent it should be  removed from the entered text.
